Objective:

     Work with the Disjoint Set data structure.

Overview:

     The Disjoint Set data structure will be used in the creation of a maze.  

Details:

     Write a program to generate and display a maze using the algorithm described in the textbook.  The program may either be a command-line program that generates a character-based maze, or it may be a GUI program that draws the maze in a window.

     The user should be able to specify the number of rows and columns in the maze, at least up to 20x20.
      
     You must use the DisjSet class from the textbook to implement the algorithm.
